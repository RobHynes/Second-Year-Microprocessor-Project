# Second-Year-Microprocessor-Project
Second Year NUIG Electronic and Computer Engineering Microprocessor Systems Music Project

For Microprocessor Systems module project. Make a musical instrument/device using an arduino and sensors.
This project used hall effect sensors to detect the presence or absence of magnets on four rotating wheels.
The readings from the four sensors are combined to create a signal that can be interpreted by the arduino to play a MIDI note on a connected laptop.
The groups final mark was 29/30 for the project.
